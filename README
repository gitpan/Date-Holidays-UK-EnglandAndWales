Date-Holidays-UK-EnglandAndWales

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

These bank and public holidays are holidays in England and Wales,
and not necessarily for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

MODULE HISTORY

This module is based on L<Date::Holidays::UK|Date::Holidays::UK>
by Richard Clamp, Amelie Guyot, Jerome Parfant, which did not contain
the dates needed by my clients.

As Msrs Clamp et al note in the L<POD for their module|Date::Holidays::UK/DESCRIPTION>,
Naming modules is a tricky thing: I've named this C<EnglandAndWales> because
the C<UK> module cannot include holidays for Northern Ireland and Scotland,
and maintain its API.
